# simulation-of-a-football-tournament
We want to simulate the progress of a football tournament (world cup 2022) composed of 32 teams divided into 8 groups each containing 4 teams.

The task at hand is to create a program to simulate matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup tournament in Qatar using the Khawarizm environment and then translate it into C.
- TP.pdf : this file contains informations about the tp and tasks to do.
- TP  - Copie_fin.alg : In this Khawarizm file, you will discover the source code written in the Z language. This programming language was developed by our professor, Mr. Zegour. It enables you to translate your Z code into C or Pascal. For additional informations about this programming language, please visit the website of Mr. Zegour : https://zegour.esi.dz/Developpement/Seriez/Nouveau.htm#k2plus.
- main.c : The result of the Z to C conversion.
This work was carried out in pairs, using a variety of data structures that we studied during our 1st year preparatory cycle in the Higher National School of Computer Science (L'Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique ESI ex-INI), such as arrays, linked lists, binary search trees, hash tables, and many more.
